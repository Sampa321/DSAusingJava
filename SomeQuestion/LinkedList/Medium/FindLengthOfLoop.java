/*
Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Examples:

Input: pos = 2,

Output: 4
Explanation: There exists a loop in the linked list and the length of the loop is 4.
Input: pos = 3,

Output: 3
Explanation: The loop is from 19 to 10. So length of loop is 19 → 33 → 10 = 3.
Input: pos = 0,

Output: 0
Explanation: There is no loop.
