/*
You are given a node del_node of a Singly Linked List where you have to delete this given node from the linked list but you are not given the head of the list.

After deleting the given node:

The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before & after the del_node node should be in the same order.
Note: It is guaranteed that there exists a node with a value equal to the del_node value and it will not be the last node of the linked list.

Examples:

Input: Linked List = 1 -> 2, del_node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: After deleting 1 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 2.

Input: Linked List = 10 -> 20 -> 4 -> 30, del_node = 20
Output: 10->4->30
Explanation: After deleting 20 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 10, 4, 30.
