/*
Given a positive integer n, find the number of perfect squares that are less than n in the sample space of perfect squares. The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …)

Examples :
Input: n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.
Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the only Perfect Square less than 3. So, the Output is 1.
