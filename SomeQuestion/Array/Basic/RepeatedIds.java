/*
Geek is given a task to select at most 10 employees for a company project. Each employee is represented by a single-digit ID number which is unique for all the selected employees for the project. Geek has a technical problem in his system which printed ID number multiple times. You are given array arr having all printed IDs. Help him to get rid of the repeated IDs.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [8, 8, 6, 2, 1]
Output: [8, 6, 2, 1]
Explanation: 8 is repeated, so takes 8 single time.
Input: arr[] = [7, 6, 7, 4, 2, 7]
Output: [7, 6, 4, 2]
Explanation: 7 and 6 are repeated, so take 7 and 6 single time.
