/*
Given two integers a and b, You have to compute their LCM and GCD and return an array containing their LCM and GCD.

Examples:
Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: [10, 5]
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.
Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: [56, 2]
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.
Input: a = 1 , b = 1
Output: [1, 1]
Explanation: LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, while their GCD is 1.
